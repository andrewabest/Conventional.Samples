# Conventional.Samples
A set of sample code to accompany my [Conventional Wisdom](https://speakerdeck.com/andrewabest/conventional-wisdom) presentation, that demonstrates a set of circumstances in which [Conventional](https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional) can be employed

## Canonical Conventional
Whilst the samples are written so that they can be independently copy-pasteable, conventional provides hooks to wire up your chosen test framework with conventional to avoid having to always specify `.WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail)`.

See [The Conventional Wiki](https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional/wiki/Configuration) for more information.
