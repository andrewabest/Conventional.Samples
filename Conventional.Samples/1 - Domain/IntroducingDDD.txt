For newcomers to domain driven design, enforcing it's practices can be a non-trivial exercise. There are enough concerns in play that if it were left to a developer to run through a mental checklist each time they wanted to construct an aggregate or entity, things would fal through the cracks. 

However without adhering strictly to certain principals, a lot of the benefit of DDD can be lost.

So what can we do?

We can inspect the types that make up our domain model, and enforce the rules we want members of our domain to conform to.
